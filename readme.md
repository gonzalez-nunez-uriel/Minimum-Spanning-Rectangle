This code implements a greedy approximation algorithm to solve the problem.
I need to find an upload the documentation I have for the algorithm.
The code is incomplete, the iteration loop runs only once. The algorithm
basically uses a starting point that (this is yet to be proven) the point
furthest away from the center of the circles. It then goes a little bit
clockwise and a little bit counter clockwise and compares which Spanning Rectangle
is smaller. It repeats this iteration until neither of those is smaller than the
previous accepted answer. The file SpanningRectangle.py contains the method to make
this comparison, but I stopped the implementation of the solution.

I documented the design and development of this project and wanted to write a blog
post about it, but never got into doing it. The last draft I made might be found
here (if I managed to find it). If so, disregard any profanity you might find in the
draft, when I talk to myself I tend to have a potty mouth.
